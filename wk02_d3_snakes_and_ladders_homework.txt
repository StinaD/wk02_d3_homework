1. to run the game:
 >type 'ruby snakes_and_ladders.rb' in terminal


2. Are there parts you don't understand:

- run.specs.sh - what is this file doing?
- why are there no tests for viewer.rb and snakes_and_ladders.rb?

- the Board class?
class Board
  def initialize(size, positions)
    @state = Array.new(size,0)
    set_up_positions(positions)
  end

  and then the functions written in board.rb

- the TurnLog?
class TurnLog
  def initialize(params)
    @player = params[:player]
    @roll = params[:roll]
    @modifier = params[:modifier]
  end

  def modifier_type
    result = :space

    result = :ladder if @modifier > 0
    result = :snake if @modifier < 0

    return result
  end


3. Dice returns a random number so the results can't be tested? (But could it not be tested to check it returns an integer?)

4. Is all the 'put's in the Viewer for efficiency and to make it easier to edit the text in the interface?
